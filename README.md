# DATA732_MassShootingUSA

The goal of the project was to provide a visualization of data from a csv file about us mass shooting with D3js. 
To visualize the data you must download the code and the json/csv files and save them in the same folder. You also have to download Live Server. Then you just have to open the file with Live Server.

we failed to display the map in html so we make it display..........

To be able to launch the card, you must:
1) be placed in the terminal at the level of the folder where the code is located,
2) launch everything with the command "node app.js".
