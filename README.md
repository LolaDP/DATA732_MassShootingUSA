# DATA732_MassShootingUSA

The goal of the project was to provide a visualization of data from a csv file about us mass shooting with D3js. 
To visualize the data you must download the code and the json/csv files and save them in the same folder. You also have to download Live Server. Then you just have to open the file with Live Server.
